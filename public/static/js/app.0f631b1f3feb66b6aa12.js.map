通过get/getBoolean/getNumber/set/settings方法设置当前平台的config\n *\n * 只有获取过的配置key会缓存到_c中, 清除_c缓冲可以使用:\n * settings({...})设置用户自定义配置\n *\n * config实例化后为单例对象,挂载点为: window.VM.config中\n *\n * Config的初始化不对外公开, 而是由setupConfig()函数执行Config的初始化\n *\n *\n *\n * Config使用的代码如下:\n * 初始化需要有平台信息, 故以下代码是依赖执行的.\n * @example\n *\n * import { providePlatformConfigs } from './platform/platform-registry'\n * import { setupPlatform } from './platform/platform'\n * import { setupConfig } from './config/config'\n * import { registerModeConfigs } from './config/mode-registry'\n * let platformConfigs = providePlatformConfigs();\n * // 初始化平台\n * let platform = setupPlatform(platformConfigs);\n * // config初始化\n * let config = setupConfig({},platform);\n * // 注册ios/md/wp三个平台的默认配置\n * registerModeConfigs(config)\n *\n *\n * 这里需要注意, 如果用户自定义对platform进行设置, 比如自定义在ios下tabsPlacement的值为top\n * 则需要这样写:\n * let config = setupConfig({\n *          tabsPlacement: 'bottom',\n *          platforms: {\n *              ios: {\n *                  tabsPlacement: 'top',\n *              }\n *          }\n * },platform);\n *\n *\n * 也可以在url中传入配置参数, 通过url配置App的前后缀, 例如htttp://xx.xx.com?vmMode=ios\n * 则配置mode将为ios, 改变mode并无法改变真实的mode环境, 因为平台验证有自己的isMatch方法, 切记!!\n *\n * 此配置将是最高优先级的配置(url获取配置信息 > 用户自定义配置 > 平台默认配置)\n * 因此这个方法将可以用于PC端测试\n *\n * 可通过set方法添加自定义的配置信息\n * config.set('ios', 'favoriteColor', 'green');\n * config.get('favoriteColor'); // 'green' when iOS\n *\n *\n *\n * | Config Property          | Type                | Details         |\n * | `activator`
